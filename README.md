## The Problem & Solution

### The Problem

When working with Claude Code or other AI agents:
- 🔥 AI doesn't understand project context → makes wrong architectural decisions
- 💸 Loads entire project into context → wastes tokens and money
- 🔄 You explain the same things repeatedly → waste time
- 🎲 Unpredictable results → no single source of truth
- 🚫 Security issues → AI doesn't know the rules

### The Solution

The framework provides **14 ready-made documentation templates** that:
- ✅ **Auto-load** into Claude Code context (via `CLAUDE.md`)
- ✅ **Save tokens** through modular architecture
- ✅ **Cold Start Protocol v1.4.0** - 85% token savings (5x cheaper!) on session reloads
- ✅ **PROJECT_SNAPSHOT.md** - instant project state overview
- ✅ **Modular focus** - loads only current module
- ✅ **Single source of truth** for AI and team
- ✅ **Built-in security** (SECURITY.md)
- ✅ **Slash commands** for automation (/commit, /pr, /migrate, etc.)
- ✅ **Standardized processes** via Makefile

### Core Components

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **CLAUDE.md** | Auto-loads in Claude Code — protocols and triggers |
| **.claude/SNAPSHOT.md** | Current state for quick context loading |
| **.claude/ARCHITECTURE.md** | Code structure and design decisions |
| **.claude/BACKLOG.md** | Implementation phases and tasks |
| **src/claude-export/** | Dialog export system source code |
| **.claude/commands/** | 19 slash commands for automation |

#### ⚡ How Slash Commands Work

**Important to understand:** Slash commands in Claude Code are **prompt expansions**, not executable scripts.

**What happens when you use `/migrate`:**
1. You type `/migrate`
2. Claude reads `.claude/commands/migrate.md` (detailed instructions)
3. Claude follows these instructions step-by-step automatically
4. You see progress as Claude executes the workflow

**Example:**
- `/migrate` → Claude reads 612-line migration guide → executes automatically
- `/commit` → Claude reads commit workflow → creates structured git commit
- `/pr` → Claude reads PR workflow → analyzes changes → creates pull request

**Key insight:** Commands ARE instructions for Claude, not shell scripts. This means:
- ✅ Claude executes them intelligently based on context
- ✅ You can interrupt and guide the process
- ✅ Commands adapt to your project structure
- ❌ They're not instant like shell commands (Claude thinks first!)

## 💰 Token Economics & ROI

### Understanding the Investment

**First-Time Setup (One-Time Cost):**
```
Initial framework read: ~15-20k tokens (~$0.15-0.20)
+ Project setup and template deployment
+ Optional: Legacy project migration
= One-time investment that pays for itself quickly
```

**Every Cold Start After (Ongoing Savings):**
```
Without framework: ~15-20k tokens (~$0.15) per restart
With framework: ~2-3k tokens (~$0.03) per restart
Savings per restart: ~$0.12 (80%!)
```

### ROI Calculation

**30 Cold Starts Per Month (typical for active project):**
```
Without optimization: 30 × $0.15 = $4.50/month
With framework: 30 × $0.03 = $0.90/month
---
Monthly savings: $3.60
Annual savings: $43.20 per project!
```

**Payback Period:** Just 2-3 cold starts! 🚀

**After that:** Pure savings on every session restart.

### Why Modular Focus Matters

The framework's modular approach provides continuous benefits:

✅ **Fewer Tokens** - Load only what you need (Auth module, not entire project)
✅ **Fewer Errors** - AI doesn't get confused in large context
✅ **Faster Responses** - Less to read and analyze
✅ **Better Accuracy** - Focused context = focused answers

**Example:**
- Monolithic: Load entire 5000-line project = ~8k tokens + higher error rate
- Modular: Load Auth module (200 lines) = ~1k tokens + precise answers

The investment pays for itself almost immediately, then continues saving on every session.

## ⚡ Cold Start Protocol: Token Optimization

### Problem: Session Reloads Waste Tokens

Every time Claude Code restarts:
- **Without optimization:** Reads ALL files → ~15-20k tokens (~$0.15-0.20)
- **With basic protocol:** Reads ONLY needed files → ~6-8k tokens (~$0.05-0.08)
- **With PROJECT_SNAPSHOT.md + modular focus:** ~2-3k tokens (~$0.02-0.03)
- **Result:** **~85% token savings = 5x cheaper!** 🚀

### How It Works

**Stage 1: PROJECT_SNAPSHOT.md - instant start (~500 tokens)**
1. AI reads PROJECT_SNAPSHOT.md FIRST
2. Sees: Phase 3 (45%), Auth Module in development
3. Loads ONLY Auth Module from BACKLOG.md and ARCHITECTURE.md
4. **~2-3k tokens instead of ~10k = 75% savings!**

**Stage 2: Modular context loading (~2-3k tokens)**
- Reads ONLY current module from BACKLOG.md
- Reads ONLY module section from ARCHITECTURE.md
- Loads ONLY current module files
- Skips other modules until needed

**Stage 3: Never Unless Asked**
- ❌ Other modules (only on request)
- ❌ MIGRATION_REPORT.md (only if user asks)
- ❌ WORKFLOW.md (only if user asks)
- ❌ archive/* (only on request)

### Automatic After Migration

When you run `/migrate-finalize`:
1. Migration Status automatically set to `✅ COMPLETED (YYYY-MM-DD)`
2. Next session AI sees this status
3. Skips reading migration report
4. **~5k tokens saved on every reload** going forward

**See CLAUDE.md → "🔄 Cold Start Protocol" for full details**

## 🧩 Philosophy: Modular Architecture

### Why modules are critical for AI work?

**Monolithic approach problem:**
```
Claude loads entire project (5000 lines) →
Wastes tokens reading everything →
Expensive and slow →
May get confused in large context
```

**Solution through modules:**
```
Claude loads only needed module (200 lines) →
Fewer tokens →
Faster and cheaper →
Better understanding of task
```

### Modularity Principle

**Application = Set of small LEGO blocks**

Each module:
- Solves **one narrow task**
- Has **clear input and output**
- Can be **tested separately**
- **Doesn't depend** on other modules

## 🎓 How to Work with the Framework

### Working with Claude Code

1. **Launch** `claude` in project root
2. **CLAUDE.md auto-loads** into context
3. **Ask AI to read PROJECT_INTAKE.md** and ask questions
4. **Work modularly**: one module → testing → next module

### Maintenance and Evolution

1. **Update BACKLOG.md** after each sprint
2. **Enhance ARCHITECTURE.md** with architectural decisions
3. **Expand AGENTS.md** with new patterns
4. **Use slash commands** to automate routine tasks

---

## 💡 Best Practices

### For PROJECT_INTAKE.md

✅ **DO:**
- Start with "**WHY?**" - problem → solution → value
- Create 2-3 User Personas with names and pain points
- Describe User Flows step-by-step (not abstractions!)
- Separate features into **unique** (build) vs **standard** (integrate ready-made)
- Plan modular structure

❌ **DON'T:**
- Leave [FILL IN] without filling
- Write abstractly without specifics
- Plan to build standard features from scratch (Auth, Payments, etc)

### For working with Claude Code

✅ **DO:**
- Use `/commit` instead of manual commits
- Load context via TodoWrite for task tracking
- Work by modules: Auth → API → Screens → Business Logic
- Ask AI to update documentation with changes

❌ **DON'T:**
- Don't load entire project into context at once
- Don't skip SECURITY.md
- Don't ignore architectural decisions from ARCHITECTURE.md

### For security

✅ **ALWAYS:**
- Read SECURITY.md before coding
- Use `.env.example` → `.env.local`
- Validate all input data
- Use `/security` slash command for audits

❌ **NEVER:**
- Commit `.env` files
- Hardcode secrets in code
- Ignore security warnings

## 📊 Framework Architecture

The framework follows a **meta-layer** approach:

```
Framework (this repo)
├── Core System
│   ├── src/claude-export/          # Dialog export engine
│   ├── dist/claude-export/         # Compiled code
│   └── package.json                # npm scripts
│
├── AI Protocols
│   ├── CLAUDE.md                   # Cold Start & Completion
│   └── .claude/
│       ├── commands/               # 19 slash commands
│       ├── SNAPSHOT.md             # Current state
│       ├── ARCHITECTURE.md         # Code structure
│       └── BACKLOG.md              # Tasks and roadmap
```

**Key principle:** Framework uses itself for development (dogfooding)
