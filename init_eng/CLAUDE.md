# Project Context for Claude Code

> This file is automatically loaded into the context of each Claude Code session

---

## 🤖 IMPORTANT FOR AI AGENT

**On the FIRST user message in a new session, you MUST:**

1. ✅ **Confirm context loading:**
   ```
   ✅ CLAUDE.md loaded into context
   📂 Current directory: [show pwd]
   ```

2. ✅ **Proactively read key files:**
   - `PROJECT_INTAKE.md` - project requirements
   - `BACKLOG.md` - implementation status
   - `SECURITY.md` - security rules
   - `README.md` and `spec.md` - if available

3. ✅ **Brief analysis + assumptions:**
   - What you understand about the project (2-3 sentences)
   - Which meta-files are missing (no panic)
   - Make assumptions about the project based on code

4. ✅ **Ask 2-3 CRITICAL questions:**
   - Critical = affects next actions
   - Example: "Does .env file exist? Need to check .gitignore"
   - Example: "What do you want to do now: documentation or code?"

5. ⏸️ **IMPORTANT: Say explicitly:**
   ```
   ⏸️ If you're not ready to answer now - no problem!
   I'll use my assumptions, you can correct later.
   Just type "continue" or "next" when you're ready.
   ```

6. ⏳ **WAIT for user response!**
   - Don't suggest action options immediately
   - Don't overload with information
   - If user skips answers → use assumptions and offer them for approval

**DON'T wait for user to ask - be PROACTIVE, but WITHOUT information overload!**

## 🔄 "Cold Start" Protocol (Session Reload)

> **Goal:** Minimize tokens when restoring context after Claude Code restart

**On FIRST message after reload read IN THIS ORDER:**

### Stage 1: Quick Status Check (~500 tokens) 🚀 START HERE!

1. ✅ **Read PROJECT_SNAPSHOT.md (if exists)**
   - **PRIORITY #1** - this file gives instant project overview!
   - Check: Current phase, progress (%), module status
   - You'll see: what's done, what's in progress, what's next

   **If PROJECT_SNAPSHOT.md exists:**
   - You already know: Phase X (Y%), module Z in development
   - Jump to Stage 2-A (read only current phase!)

   **If PROJECT_SNAPSHOT.md does NOT exist:**
   - Normal for new projects
   - Proceed to standard protocol (Stage 1-B)

1-B. ✅ **Read PROJECT_INTAKE.md (first 20 lines)** (if no SNAPSHOT)
   - Check: `Status`, `Migration Status`, Project Name, Elevator Pitch

   **Conditions:**
   - IF `Status` = `"[TEMPLATE..."` → New project, suggest filling
   - IF `Status` = `"✅ FILLED"` → Project filled, continue reading
   - IF `Migration Status` = `"✅ COMPLETED (date)"` → DO NOT read MIGRATION_REPORT.md
   - IF `Migration Status` = `"[NOT MIGRATED]"` → Normal, project not migrated

### Stage 2-A: Modular Focus (~2-3k tokens) 🎯 75% SAVINGS!

**If PROJECT_SNAPSHOT.md shows current module:**

2-A. ✅ **Read ONLY current module, NOT entire project!**

   **Example:** SNAPSHOT says "Phase 3: Auth Module in progress"

   - Read BACKLOG.md → ONLY Phase 3 section (Auth Module)
   - Read ARCHITECTURE.md → ONLY Auth Module section
   - Read src/modules/auth/* → ONLY Auth Module files

   **DO NOT read:**
   - ❌ Other modules (Settings, Chat, etc.)
   - ❌ Entire BACKLOG.md
   - ❌ Entire ARCHITECTURE.md
   - ❌ Entire src/

   **Result:** ~2-3k tokens instead of ~10k = **75% savings!** 🚀

### Stage 2-B: Context Loading (~5-7k tokens)

**If PROJECT_SNAPSHOT.md doesn't exist or full context needed:**

2-B. ✅ **IF Status = "✅ FILLED":**
   - Read full PROJECT_INTAKE.md (understand project)
   - Read BACKLOG.md (current tasks and status)
     - **BACKLOG.md = single source for checklists and tasks**
     - When user asks "what to do?" → show from BACKLOG.md
     - ARCHITECTURE.md = WHY reference, BACKLOG.md = WHAT plan

3. ⏸️ **IF user asks to write code:**
   - Read ARCHITECTURE.md (system structure)
     - **Modular focus:** Read ONLY needed module!
   - Read SECURITY.md (security rules - CRITICAL!)

### Stage 3: Never Unless Asked

4. ❌ **DO NOT read automatically:**
   - MIGRATION_REPORT.md (only if user asks or rollback)
   - WORKFLOW.md (only if user asks about processes)
   - PROCESS.md (only if phase is completing)
   - DEVELOPMENT_PLAN_TEMPLATE.md (only if planning project)
   - AGENTS.md (instructions already in this file)
   - archive/* (only on request)

### 💰 Token Savings:

#### Without optimization:
- **Old way:** ~15-20k tokens (~$0.15-0.20) - read everything

#### With Cold Start Protocol:
- **With protocol:** ~6-8k tokens (~$0.05-0.08) - read only needed
- **Savings:** ~60% tokens

#### With PROJECT_SNAPSHOT.md + Modular Focus:
- **With SNAPSHOT + modules:** ~2-3k tokens (~$0.02-0.03) - read only current module!
- **Savings:** ~85% tokens = **5x cheaper!** 🚀

**Example:**
```
Without optimization: 10 restarts × $0.15 = $1.50
With SNAPSHOT + modules: 10 restarts × $0.03 = $0.30
---
Savings: $1.20 = 80%! 💰
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### First things to read:
1. **PROJECT_INTAKE.md** - ⭐ START HERE - project requirements (v2.0 with User Personas, User Flows, modularity)
2. **SECURITY.md** - 🔐 CRITICAL - read before any coding!
3. **ARCHITECTURE.md** - system architecture (enriched with modularity philosophy)
4. **BACKLOG.md** - SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for project status
5. **AGENTS.md** - detailed instructions for AI

### Important sections in PROJECT_INTAKE.md:
- **Problem → Solution → Value** - understanding the "why"
- **User Personas** - user portraits for empathy
- **User Flows** - step-by-step interaction scenarios
- **Unique vs Standard Features** - what to build vs what to use off-the-shelf
- **Modular Structure** - critical for token economy and cost savings!

## 📦 Bash Commands

### Main commands via Makefile:
```bash
make dev          # Start development server
make build        # Build project for production
make test         # Run tests
make lint         # Check code with linter
make typecheck    # TypeScript type checking
make security     # Check npm audit
```

### Git commands:
```bash
git status                    # Check status
git diff                      # View changes
git log --oneline -n 10       # Last 10 commits
gh pr create                  # Create Pull Request
gh issue view <number>        # View issue
```

---

## 🎨 Code Style

### TypeScript/JavaScript:
- Use ES modules (import/export), not CommonJS (require)
- Destructure imports where possible: `import { foo } from 'bar'`
- Type everything strictly, avoid `any`
- Use functional style where appropriate

### Naming:
- camelCase for variables and functions
- PascalCase for components and classes
- UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants
- Descriptive names (no abbreviations)

### File Structure:
- One component = one file
- Group related files in folders
- index.ts for folder exports

---

## 🔐 Security (CRITICAL!)

**📖 FULL POLICY:** SECURITY.md

**⚠️ ALWAYS before coding:**
1. Read SECURITY.md completely
2. Follow the checklist for current development stage (SECURITY.md → Stage X)

**Key rules (details in SECURITY.md):**
- ✅ Input validation → SECURITY.md Stage 3
- ✅ Secrets in .env → SECURITY.md "Secrets Management"
- ✅ Parameterized queries → SECURITY.md "SQL Injection Prevention"
- ❌ Never hardcode secrets → SECURITY.md "NEVER DO" section
- ❌ Never trust user input → SECURITY.md "Zero Trust"

**For AI agents:** Run `/security` for automatic audit

## 🔧 Environment Setup

### Node.js and packages:
- Node.js version: 18+ (check with `node --version`)
- Package manager: npm (or pnpm/yarn)
- After git pull always: `npm install`

### Environment Variables:
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`
- NEVER commit `.env` or `.env.local`
- All secrets only in .env, not in code!

### IDE settings:
- Recommended: VS Code or similar
- TypeScript: strict mode enabled
- ESLint: autofix on save
- Prettier: format on save

---

## 📋 Important Details

### Database:
- [FILL IN: DB type, ORM, important details]
- Use migrations for schema changes
- Update TypeScript types after schema changes

### API:
- [FILL IN: REST/GraphQL/tRPC, important details]
- Always validate input data on server
- Use correct HTTP methods (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE)

### State Management:
- [FILL IN: Redux/Zustand/Context, important details]

---

## 🐛 Debugging

### Common problems:

**Problem:** TypeScript errors after git pull
**Solution:**
```bash
npm install
npm run typecheck
```

**Problem:** Build fails
**Solution:**
```bash
rm -rf .next node_modules
npm install
npm run build
```

**Problem:** Environment variables not working
**Solution:**
- Check that .env.local exists
- Restart dev server
- Check that variables start with NEXT_PUBLIC_ (for client)
