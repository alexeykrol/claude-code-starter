## 🎯 Development Philosophy

### Core Principles
1. **Documentation is code** - Keep docs in sync with implementation
2. **Incremental progress** - Small, focused changes over large refactors
3. **Test before commit** - Validate changes in development environment
4. **Security by design** - Consider security at every stage, not as afterthought
5. **Sprint completion** - Finish what you start, document what you finish

### Goals
- Maintain living documentation that reflects current state
- Enable easy onboarding for new developers (human or AI)
- Create clear audit trail via git history
- Support rollback to any completed sprint

## 🔄 Sprint Structure

### Sprint Lifecycle
```
🎯 START SPRINT
│
├── 1. PLANNING
│   ├── Read relevant documentation (ARCHITECTURE.md, BACKLOG.md, SECURITY.md)
│   ├── Create TodoWrite task list
│   ├── Identify dependencies and risks
│   └── 🔐 SECURITY: Identify threats, sensitive data, auth requirements (see SECURITY.md Stage 1)
│
├── 2. DESIGN/ARCHITECTURE (if needed)
│   ├── Design component/feature architecture
│   ├── Plan data flow
│   └── 🔐 SECURITY: Design secure architecture, secrets management, access control (see SECURITY.md Stage 2)
│
├── 3. IMPLEMENTATION
│   ├── Follow existing patterns (see AGENTS.md)
│   ├── Write tests as you go (if applicable)
│   ├── Document decisions in comments
│   ├── Update TodoWrite progress
│   └── 🔐 SECURITY: Validate input, sanitize output, no hardcoded secrets (see SECURITY.md Stage 3)
│
├── 4. FUNCTIONAL TESTING
│   ├── Manual testing in dev environment
│   ├── Run automated tests (when available)
│   ├── Verify edge cases
│   └── Check performance impact
│
├── 5. SECURITY TESTING (MANDATORY)
│   ├── 🔐 Run npm audit (check dependencies)
│   ├── 🔐 Scan for secrets in code
│   ├── 🔐 Test authentication/authorization
│   ├── 🔐 Test input validation (XSS, injection)
│   └── 🔐 Review against SECURITY.md Stage 4 checklist
│
├── 6. EXPERIMENTATION & ITERATION
│   ├── Try alternative approaches if needed
│   ├── Rollback if approach doesn't work
│   ├── Refine solution based on testing
│   ├── Re-test security after changes
│   └── Final implementation
│
└── 7. COMPLETION (MANDATORY)
    ├── ✅ Verify functional requirements met
    ├── 🔐 Verify security requirements met (both independent!)
    ├── Update BACKLOG.md (status change)
    ├── Update ARCHITECTURE.md (if architectural changes)
    ├── Update AGENTS.md (if new patterns/rules)
    ├── Update README.md (if user-facing changes)
    ├── Update SECURITY.md (if security patterns discovered)
    ├── [Update other docs if needed]
    ├── Verify all TodoWrite tasks marked complete
    └── Create sprint completion commit

🎉 END SPRINT
```

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** Sprint is NOT complete until BOTH functional AND security requirements are satisfied.

## 📚 Documentation Maintenance

### When to Update Each File

#### BACKLOG.md
- **When:** Feature status changes (started, completed, cancelled)
- **Frequency:** Every sprint completion
- **Owner:** Any developer/agent completing a sprint

#### ARCHITECTURE.md
- **When:** New architectural patterns, components, or decisions
- **Frequency:** Major features or refactoring sprints
- **Owner:** Developer/agent making architectural changes

#### AGENTS.md
- **When:** New patterns discovered, rules established, or common issues found
- **Frequency:** Any sprint where new knowledge gained
- **Owner:** Any developer/agent who discovers new patterns

#### README.md
- **When:** User-facing changes, version updates, installation changes
- **Frequency:** Each minor/major version release
- **Owner:** Developer/agent completing user-facing features

### Documentation Review Cadence
- **After each sprint:** Verify all updates made
- **Monthly:** Review for consistency across files
- **Before release:** Comprehensive documentation audit

---

## 🎯 Best Practices

### DO ✅
- ✅ Commit early and often during development
- ✅ Use descriptive branch names
- ✅ Update documentation as you code, not after
- ✅ Test before committing
- ✅ Use TodoWrite to track progress
- ✅ Follow existing patterns from AGENTS.md
- ✅ Complete sprint checklists before moving on

### DON'T ❌
- ❌ Skip documentation updates
- ❌ Commit broken code to main
- ❌ Make unrelated changes in same commit
- ❌ Use vague commit messages ("fix bug", "update code")
- ❌ Leave WIP code without comments
- ❌ Push directly to main without review (if team policy)
- ❌ Forget to update BACKLOG.md status

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting Workflow Issues

### Issue: Documentation out of sync
**Solution:** Run documentation audit sprint
1. Compare code to ARCHITECTURE.md
2. Verify BACKLOG.md status matches reality
3. Update all discrepancies
4. Create "docs: synchronize documentation" commit

### Issue: Unclear what to work on next
**Solution:** Consult prioritization hierarchy
1. Check BACKLOG.md "In Progress" section
2. Then "High Priority" features
3. Then "Technical Debt" if no features
4. Discuss with team if still unclear

### Issue: Git conflicts
**Solution:** Standard git conflict resolution
```bash
git pull origin main
# Resolve conflicts in editor
git add [resolved-files]
git commit -m "Merge main, resolve conflicts"
```

### Issue: Lost sprint progress
**Solution:** Use git history
```bash
# View commit history
git log --oneline

# Restore to specific commit
git checkout [commit-hash]

# Create recovery branch
git checkout -b recovery/lost-work
```

## 📝 Notes for Customization

When adapting this file for a specific project:

1. **Replace [PROJECT_NAME]** and [DATE]
2. **Remove inapplicable sections** (e.g. Database Sprint if no DB)
3. **Add project-specific processes**
4. **Update commands** (npm run dev → vite, etc)
5. **Adapt for team** (solo developer vs team)
6. **Delete this section** after setup
